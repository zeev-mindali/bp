    ## Link On/Off State of Multiple Devices v1.2 - zeev mindali
    1) It triggers not only on a state change, but also every minute, to eliminate a problem with very fast changes on/off with last one not triggering anything and entities become unsincronized.
    2) It does not trigger when initial entity state is unavailable or unknown. It solves the problem with a ton of zigbee devices firstly sending this status after HA reboot, then sending their real one, trigerring all automations based on the v1 template.
    3) Fixed log errors
